    <summary>Yet Another Favicon Downloader for KeePass 2.x</summary>
    <description>_Yet Another Favicon Downloader_ (_YAFD_ for short) is a plugin for _KeePass_ 2.x that allows you to quickly download favicons for your password entries.

### Features

- Concurrent and responsive (allows faster downloads without freezing the user interface)
- Lightweight and reliable (designed to download thousands of icons in batch)
- Smart and efficient
  - Avoids duplicate icons (reuses custom icons already present in the database)
  - Download entries without a URL scheme (automatically prefix URLs with `http://`)
- Linux support (_experimental_)
- Proxy support (respects _KeePass_ settings)
    </description>
    <releaseNotes>### New features
- Adds `Name` and `Last Modification Time` for newly downloaded custom icons on KeePass 2.48+.
(issue #61)
- Resize large icons to sizes from 16px to 128px. (issue #60).
- Adds Custom Download Provider option. (pull request #62, thanks @Henri-J-Norden).

### Improvements
- Use cookies between requests when download favicons from a website (pull request #54) (thanks @Eelke76).
- When there is no icon in the specified URL, try looking at the root of the domain.
- Improve retry logic in case of failures.
- Adds support to TLS 1.3 if it's available.
- Chocolatey installation instructions (pull request #63) (thanks @4-FLOSS-Free-Libre-Open-Source-Software)
