    <summary>Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets</summary>
    <description>
Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.

The key features of Vault are:

* **Secure Secret Storage**: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, [Consul](https://www.consul.io), and more.
* **Dynamic Secrets**: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.
* **Data Encryption**: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as SQL without having to design their own encryption methods.
* **Leasing and Renewal**: All secrets in Vault have a _lease_ associated with it. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.
* **Revocation**: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.

#### October 25, 2023

CHANGES:

* core: Bump Go version to 1.21.3.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* api/plugins: add `tls-server-name` arg for plugin registration [[GH-23549](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23549)]
* auto-auth/azure: Support setting the `authenticate_from_environment` variable to "true" and "false" string literals, too. [[GH-22996](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/22996)]
* secrets-sync (enterprise): Added telemetry on number of destinations and associations per type.
* ui: Adds a warning when whitespace is detected in a key of a KV secret [[GH-23702](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23702)]
* ui: Adds toggle to KV secrets engine value download modal to optionally stringify value in downloaded file [[GH-23747](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23747)]
* ui: Surface warning banner if UI has stopped auto-refreshing token [[GH-23143](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23143)]
* ui: show banner when resultant-acl check fails due to permissions or wrong namespace. [[GH-23503](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23503)]
* website/docs: fix inaccuracies with unauthenticated_in_flight_requests_access parameter [[GH-23287](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23287)]

BUG FIXES:

* Seal HA (enterprise/beta): Fix rejection of a seal configuration change
from two to one auto seal due to persistence of the previous seal type being
"multiseal". [[GH-23573](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23573)]
* audit: Fix bug reopening 'file' audit devices on SIGHUP. [[GH-23598](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23598)]
* auth/aws: Fixes a panic that can occur in IAM-based login when a [client config](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/aws#configure-client) does not exist. [[GH-23555](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23555)]
* command/server: Fix bug with sigusr2 where pprof files were not closed correctly [[GH-23636](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23636)]
* events: Ignore sending context to give more time for events to send [[GH-23500](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23500)]
* expiration: Prevent large lease loads from delaying state changes, e.g. becoming active or standby. [[GH-23282](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23282)]
* kmip (enterprise): Improve handling of failures due to storage replication issues.
* kmip (enterprise): Return a structure in the response for query function Query Server Information.
* mongo-db: allow non-admin database for root credential rotation [[GH-23240](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23240)]
* replication (enterprise): Fix a bug where undo logs would only get enabled on the initial node in a cluster.
* replication (enterprise): Fix a missing unlock when changing replication state
* secrets-sync (enterprise): Fixed issue where we could sync a deleted secret
* secrets/aws: update credential rotation deadline when static role rotation period is updated [[GH-23528](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23528)]
* secrets/consul: Fix revocations when Vault has an access token using specific namespace and admin partition policies [[GH-23010](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23010)]
* secrets/pki: Stop processing in-flight ACME verifications when an active node steps down [[GH-23278](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23278)]
* secrets/transit (enterprise): Address an issue using sign/verify operations with managed keys returning an error about it not containing a private key
* secrets/transit (enterprise): Address panic when using GCP,AWS,Azure managed keys for encryption operations. At this time all encryption operations for the cloud providers have been disabled, only signing operations are supported.
* secrets/transit (enterprise): Apply hashing arguments and defaults to managed key sign/verify operations
* secrets/transit: Do not allow auto rotation on managed_key key types [[GH-23723](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23723)]
* storage/consul: fix a bug where an active node in a specific sort of network
partition could continue to write data to Consul after a new leader is elected
potentially causing data loss or corruption for keys with many concurrent
writers. For Enterprise clusters this could cause corruption of the merkle trees
leading to failure to complete merkle sync without a full re-index. [[GH-23013](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23013)]
* ui: Assumes version 1 for kv engines when options are null because no version is specified [[GH-23585](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23585)]
* ui: Decode the connection url for display on the connection details page [[GH-23695](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23695)]
* ui: Fix AWS secret engine to allow empty policy_document field. [[GH-23470](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23470)]
* ui: Fix bug where auth items were not listed when within a namespace. [[GH-23446](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23446)]
* ui: Fix regression that broke the oktaNumberChallenge on the ui. [[GH-23565](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23565)]
* ui: Fix the copy token button in the sidebar navigation window when in a collapsed state. [[GH-23331](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/23331)]
