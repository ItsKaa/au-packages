    <releaseNotes>In this version we have made significant changes to how we record configuration of entries and their form fields. In almost all cases there will be no visible impact of the change but it allows us to add a variety of long-desired features to Kee in future. Rolling back to version 1.x is not possible without a corresponding rollback to your backup KDBX file so please check everything works correctly before making a lot of changes to the information stored in your KDBX file.

See the corresponding beta testing announcement for more details:

https://forum.kee.pm/t/keepassrpc-version-2-is-now-available-for-beta-testing/4501

As usual, we will be enabling the update notifications for this version at least a week or two after we have set this as the latest stable release.</releaseNotes>
