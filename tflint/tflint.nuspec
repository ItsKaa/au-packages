    <summary>TFLint is a Terraform linter</summary>
    <description>TFLint is a Terraform linter for detecting errors that can not be detected by terraform plan.

TFLint is a framework and each feature is provided by plugins, the key features are as follows:

- Find possible errors (like invalid instance types) for Major Cloud providers (AWS/Azure/GCP).
- Warn about deprecated syntax, unused declarations.
- Enforce best practices, naming conventions.

#### Breaking Changes
* Call local modules by default by @wata727 in https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/pull/1918
  * Module inspection is now enabled by default for modules whose source is a relative path. Note that "module inspection" will be called "calling modules" after this change. See also https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/issues/1066
  * CLI flag `--module` has been changed to `--call-module-type`. For backward compatibility, `--module` will continue to work, but it will be removed in a future version, so we recommend migrating early. The same applies to the `module` attribute of the configuration file.
    * `--module` flag is replaced by `--call-module-type=all` and `--no-module` (previous default) is replaced by `--call-module-type=none`
  * For modules with many local module calls, this change may result in performance degradation. If this is not acceptable, you can keep the previous default by specifying `--call-module-type=none`.
* Make assignments to undeclared variables an error by @wata727 in https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/pull/1941
  * In line with Terraform behavior, assignments using the `--var` flag etc. to undeclared variables now result in an error. To avoid this, remove unnecessary variable assignments.

#### Enhancements
* Print the working directory on error in recursive inspection by @wata727 in https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/pull/1933
* Enable per-runner parallelism by @wata727 in https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/pull/1944

#### BugFixes
* Exit with an error if the explicitly passed `.tflint.hcl` does not exist by @wata727 in https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/pull/1940
